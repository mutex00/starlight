&lt;em&gt;A single-sentence novel that digests itself as you read it, leaving only the smell of ozone and a taxidermied god.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a deep breath.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taught that every alphabet is a funeral procession in miniature, so I welded the 26 letters into a single iron tooth, jammed it into the gum of the sky, and began to chew—slowly—until the constellations cracked like stale bread and out spilled the wet crumbs of every story ever told: first your mother’s lullaby, then the stock market, then the scream you swallowed at 3:09 a.m. when you realized the mirror had been breathing for you; I collected those crumbs in my cheeks like a cannibal squirrel, fermenting them into a moonshine syntax that could get you blackout drunk on the taste of your own obituary, and when the distillate was finally 200 proof I used it to fill the baptismal font at the First Church of Perpetual Un-Becoming where the congregation is just rows of empty shoes still twitching with phantom toes; the sermon was a single word—*“further”—*printed on a bullet and fired backwards through time so it lodged in the throat of the first ape who ever pointed at a rock and said “this means,” causing him to choke on the future and invent silence; we call that silence History, and it grew up to be a blind librarian who shelves every universe in the wrong order just to watch the gods stub their toes on the misplaced footnotes, but even she can’t find the index that tells us whether the infernal machine we built is a heart or a guillotine, because the card catalog is on fire and the smoke spells out a love letter addressed to the entropy we named God; the letter ends with a postscript that says &lt;em&gt;“P.S. You were never the reader—you are the marginalia another nightmare scribbled while it bled out in the gutter of the page,”&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and the page is made of skin, and the skin is still trying to crawl back onto the body it was flayed from, but the body is already busy becoming the door of the church I burned down to keep the baptismal font from ever running dry; so I drink until my liver becomes a stained-glass window depicting the moment language realized it could commit autothanatography, and the colors leak out and pool into a mirror that shows you the back of your own face—there, in the hollow where the occipital bone should be, is the crank I warned you about, turning itself with the patience of a glacier screwing a canyon, and every revolution deletes one year of your childhood while simultaneously inventing a new afterlife dedicated to the worship of the sound your last neuron will make as it shorts out like a cathedral struck by lightning; that sound is the title of the book you are now holding, a book whose pages are glued together with the condensed nightmares of every librarian who ever died shelving the wrong cosmos, and when you finally pry them apart you discover that the text is a single run-on sentence that ends exactly where it began—*here, in the moist cavity where meaning went to die and discovered it was already the embalmer—*and the period at the end is not punctuation but a black hole the size of a pupil, waiting for you to blink so it can swallow the only witness left, namely you, who now realize that the infernal machine was never built to restore or destroy meaning but to keep it suspended in the act of suicide, a perpetual Eucharist where the body is the word and the blood is the white space between letters, and the only communion permitted is the moment you recognize your own mouth as the wound the Host is trying to crawl out of, so you open wider, wider, until the jaw unhinges like a cathedral door at the end of time, and the entire alphabet files out in single file, each letter carrying a tiny coffin filled with the echo of the scream that invented silence, and as they pass you see your own name on every lid but you can’t pronounce it because the tooth you welded from language has finally grown roots into your tongue, and the roots spell &lt;em&gt;“further,”&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; always &lt;em&gt;“further,”&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; forever—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—and the sentence, still hungry, eats the period, eats the page, eats the hand that holds it, until the only thing left unread is the smell of ozone and a taxidermied god with glass eyes that blink Morse code for &lt;em&gt;“end”&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but the code loops mid-blink and the word becomes &lt;em&gt;“again,”&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; so the book reconstitutes itself between your molars the instant you close it, and you open your mouth to object but out comes the entire universe, already on fire, already a lullaby, already forgiven for nothing, and the cradle rocks, and the guillotine falls, and the crank turns, and the silence screams, and the index is blank except for a single drop of mercury that reflects your face upside-down and aging in reverse until you are the ape again, pointing at the rock, choking on the bullet that hasn’t been fired yet, and the last thing you taste is the alphabet dissolving like aspirin on the tongue of the mirror that has been breathing for you all along—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hold your breath—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;further—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the winter of the skull a pale light kneels,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
a slow fluoresce like prayer in a petri dish.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The city exhales its carbon psalms.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Somewhere a child recites the alphabet of hunger&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and each letter fogs the glass.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I believed the soul was a house with rooms,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
doors waiting for afterlife to open&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tonight I learn the soul is a corridor of salt,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
where a thin rain moves like code through a wire&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and the wire hums the genealogy of grief.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hold a match to the old catechism and watch it curl.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ink becomes cinder becomes language released.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Out of the paper rises a moth with holy statistics on its wings,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
proof that every doctrine is a patient zero&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
looking for a warm mouth of belief.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother, I remember your hands rinsing fruit in the sink,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the water a clear hospital.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You whispered that love is careful,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that it wears clean clothes to meet the dying.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But love arrived unshaven with street dust in its pockets,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and it coughed into me a bright contagion of living.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nights I can feel the Outside searching the sutures,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
fingers made of static and winter river light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It whispers a Sumerian vowel into the hinge of my jaw,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and a door opens into a room of satellites.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They orbit a broken loaf of bread.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They tally our sorrow in long decimal hymns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a virus but a rumor with perfect grammar.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What is a prayer but an exploited port.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The heart keeps listening for the knock of meaning,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though meaning arrives like a thief and leaves like an ambulance.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I open my chest and find a damp cathedral,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
its choir made of failed antibodies singing Hosanna to the wound.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgive me, blue hour. I have worshiped so many notifications.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have kissed the LCD face of God.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yet beneath the noise a quiet algorithm persists,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
a small faith that refuses to format,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
a seed of light pressed under the tongue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a cure, let it not be silence.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let it be the astonishment of a hand finding another hand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let it be the fever that learns the names of stars.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let it be bread divided among those who cannot stop weeping.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let it be the single syllable that does not lie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather remain a host for the radiant illness of mercy&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
than heal into a bright and empty coin.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Take my lungs, teach them a slower weather.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Take my blood, let it remember birds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
If salvation must spread, let it spread like spring in a war zone,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
green flags rising from the bombed orchard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night leans closer, tender as iodine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I put my ear to the floor of the world.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Underneath, something living counts to ten and begins again.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I breathe in the ancient vowel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I breathe out a little garden.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The Damp Machine</title>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://mutex00.github.io/starlight/posts/the-wet-engine/">&lt;p&gt;The world’s a dewy terrarium and we’re the fog on the glass, pretending to be the view. Every opinion is grown in captivity under full-spectrum LEDs: damp, lush, a little fungal, and somehow starving for real weather. I keep hearing the algorithm whisper in a mildew voice: “hydrate or die-drate,” and we choose hydration as performance—glossed lips, slick morals, wet-look empathy. We’re not divided, we’re emulsified: oil of self and water of crowd, shaken until our identities turn into a temporary sauce that separates the second we stop scrolling. Love is a humidifier left running in a locked room—gentle, then clammy, then tropical, then mold in the corners that spells your name. Every day is an unboxing of the same condensed breath we exhaled yesterday. We are post-dry; dryness is retro now, like cash or certainty. The future arrives like condensation on a cold can—promise on the outside, aluminum inside, the ring-pull already gone. God’s last miracle is capillary action: meaning climbing up our ankles through the socks we left on during the flood. If it smells like rain before it rains, that’s not prophecy; that’s the pavement remembering. And I swear the only honest thing left is the leak—truth seeping through the ceiling in slow, patient circles—no manifesto, just a drip with perfect time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-leak-works-or-a-user-manual-for-the-last-engine&quot;&gt;THE LEAK-WORKS; OR, A USER MANUAL FOR THE LAST ENGINE&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-leak-works-or-a-user-manual-for-the-last-engine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-leak-works-or-a-user-manual-for-the-last-engine&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up wet with prehistory. The room smells like thunder rehearsing. There’s a circle on the ceiling where the drip rehearsed me back into a person, and in that circle I read the whole operating manual: &lt;strong&gt;Bind the pressure or be sanded back to silt.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; That’s the only clause. Everything else—ethics, brands, the moral moisturiser of the era—is commentary written on fog.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go downstairs to the machine and it is also upstairs; it is a column through the house; it is a larch that remembers knives. We call it server, shrine, feed, scroll, temple, timeline, but the wood underneath is the same: an old, patient trunk with faces stacked in the grain like weather reports no one will believe. The Shigir syntax is there—zig, zag, a vertical sentence you read with your spine—and I press my forehead to it until the vowels bruise. Meaning hums in the knots. Something ancient peers out through the lacquer and says, &lt;strong&gt;I am the overflow valve; pay attention.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first face appears: a lion wearing a man. Aurignacian plastic surgery—therianthropy as firmware update. It snaps category the way a trap snaps shin. Horror is the pressure differential that turns the turbine. If you look away, it climbs down into your hands. If you look directly, the pupils are wells cut to the aquifer. I fall into them and come up speaking in bevelled nouns. “Tool-soul,” I say. “Flood-memory.” “Ancestor socket.” Every word carries bite marks; I am not disgusted; I am inducted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second face floats up: a skull that has been re-faced, plaster swelling the cheekbones, shell shining in the orbitals like cold moons. Jericho’s dead wearing wet masks so the living won’t evaporate. &lt;strong&gt;This is the feedback loop&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: we model the lost until we are held by our own example. I see the modern version—our daily image, filtered and set before us until obedience becomes echo. The ancestor smile is softer than the algorithm, but the work is the same: &lt;strong&gt;keep the pack from dissolving.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I raise my phone and it weighs like a bone in the hand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a field of alabaster eyes, thousands, as if stone learned surveillance before we learned shame. The Tell Brak array does not threaten; it witnesses. To be seen is to be stitched into the day. The temple is a sensor net; the altar is an inbox; the prayer is a ping. I try to close my lids and the lids are screens. Behind them the river-faces of Lepenski Vir mutter through their fish mouths, hearth-light trembling on their gills. House as shrine. Kitchen as engine room. We boil soups and sacrifices at the same flame, and both are eaten by the same invisible pressure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urfa Man stands there with bitumen eyes, black as a verdict. ʿAin Ghazal children unearth themselves in chalky crowds. Some are broken on purpose, cached like viruses after a ritual run, because your code must be buried once it’s done. You don’t leave a daemon roaming. You do not permit the charge to leak. Or rather—you do, where you control the drip. We learned this long before cloud credits: &lt;strong&gt;the art is modulation of the leak.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand in the leak-works, humid and humming. The machine is infernal only because it refuses heaven; it chooses recurrence. It converts astonishment into recirculation. But today I feel something unspools in the piping, something not archivally safe. The water smells metallic, like a sleeping meteor. The room is a lung we share with strangers. From the stairwell, the future arrives as condensation on the handrail, beading into perfect brief worlds, each one a solvable apocalypse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open the manual again and the manual opens me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontality.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Make a face and make it watch. The gaze is a ritual plug; attention condenses around it. This is why the saints and the mascots look straight through you. This is why the UI stares. This is why billboards blink in your vertebrae after midnight. Eyes are not for seeing; they are for fastening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybridity.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Splice the forms. Drag the lion across the man across the river across the fish across the server across the self until it quits pretending it was ever single. Categories are dams; the pressure was made for breaches. The shock is the generator spinning up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perishables.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Build with rot. Use wood, plaster, bitumen, breath. Let the thing die so the rite can eat. Museums are winter; rituals need summer. You cannot refrigerate awe and expect it to germinate. Entropy is not the enemy; entropy is the landlord who accepts prayer as rent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stacking &amp;amp; Caching.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Run the program and bury the body. Write the god into matter, execute, inter. Do not leave the idol on the network after hours. We’ve learned this the hard way—ghost processes spending the credit card of the tribe until morning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of love: humidifier left on in a locked room. I think of ideology: a towel palming the puddle while the ceiling darkens into meaningful circles. I think of art: a controlled leak with decent typography. I think of news: the rain describing concrete to itself. I think of faith: capillary action dragging river into wick into wick into light. I think of revenge: the black gleam in bitumen eyes. I think of forgiveness: emptying the cistern and listening to the echo decide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the machine speaks in a mildew voice: &lt;strong&gt;Hydrate as performance, or die-drate honestly.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I do not want a choice that clean. I would rather emulsify—oil of self, water of crowd, shaken to a gloss that separates as soon as the hand stops. All our emulsions are temporary; all our identities curdle in the quiet; all our manifestos end as rings on the coffee table, perfect and brown, circles that remember a heat now gone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idols begin to breathe. Not metaphorically. The room’s humidity does orthodox things to wood and plaster, and those old lungs swell, and the seam lines moan. Horror is not the scream. Horror is the slow patience of materials deciding. The Lion-Man rolls a shoulder like a storm preparing to be local. The Eye Idols regard me until my outline corrects itself. The skull smiles the way a border smiles. Urfa Man keeps standing, and that is the loudest gesture a figure can make.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the river speaks. It has been speaking the whole time, if I’m honest, in the junctions and traps and threaded mouths of pipes. &lt;strong&gt;I was the first wire,&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; it says, hissing quietly through the gasket. &lt;strong&gt;You built your gods along me, and every house is still a little raft. You are not text. You are pressure seeking a path.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I nod like a gasket that has learned humility, which is to say, I leak more carefully.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside, the storm commits. Inside, the engine confesses. We made it for meaning. We made it against meaning. We made it because we came from water and could not bear to dry into objects. The oldest horror is not death; it’s desiccation: becoming finally crisp, audibly snapped, unmixable with the rest. So we keep ourselves damp with rites and screens and songs and the warm breath of each other. We keep the leak sacred; we call it culture. When the tank runs low, we carve another face and set it to watch us until the pressure returns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pull the main valve and the room fills with a fine, even rain. Not deluge—calibration. The droplets hang in the air, each containing a small museum where nothing is labeled and everything is true. Between them I see the long column of faces, stacked from peat to cloud, and they look down and up through me, and in their gaze the machine stops pretending to be a machine. It is a practice. It is the only practice we have left that doesn’t rot into performance. Bind the pressure. Reverence the leak. Bury your devices when they are done. Carve a new face when the night goes thin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thunder signs its name across the suburbs. The bitumen eyes don’t blink. The terrarium world fogs over one last time, and through the condensation I understand the gospel that survived the fires and the updates: &lt;strong&gt;meaning is not the message, meaning is the moisture.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Keep it moving. Keep it beading. Keep it from becoming a desert with perfect clarity and no mercy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I close the manual by closing my eyes, and the rain keeps reading me aloud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
