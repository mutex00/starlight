In the winter of his fifty-ninth year, Elias Corcoran's brother Jonathan had died. Elias returned to the house on Wraith’s Hollow Road to catalogue what remained of his brother.

He arrived at dusk. Snow lifted off the marsh like breath and hung in the reeds, and the fieldstones along the low fence shone with a damp, brown sheen, as if exhumed. The house itself seemed overly narrow for the land around it, too tall, as though it had been persuaded to keep growing long after it wanted to stop. The glass in the window was warped with a slight inward sag, reflecting nothing of him. It had been empty thirty-one days.

As he let himself in with the iron key the sheriff had given him, something unnerved him. He felt something that was not exactly fear, not grief, not even foreboding. Perhaps it was older than those. It felt like standing in a cathedral that had been buried for centuries and unearthed still lit.

He called his brother’s name once.

Then he stopped, ashamed of the impulse.

There was little to clean. Jonathan Corcoran had lived like a man already leaving: a cot pushed against the library wall, notebooks in stacks on the floor, plates rinsed and dried, a single mug. No sign of struggle, the sheriff had said. No forced entry. No body. Just the message.

Elias had not seen the message himself. He had refused, in town, to look at it under that clerk’s office light with a stranger hovering over him, narrating his own brother’s final act as if it were a paragraph in a report. He would read it here, alone.

He set his case by the door and went first to the hearth in the front room. The ash was disturbed, black pulled back to show the faint red ghosts of embers, as though someone had raked it in the last hour. He crouched. Heat breathed against his knuckles. The fire had been dead for a month.

This, he decided, was a problem for later. He would not be made superstitious in the first five minutes.

He straightened, joints complaining. He had the sort of body that time carves honestly, without mercy or ornament. His coat still wore the smell of the train and his right eye watered in the cold. His hands shook, but that had been true for years.

He turned to the library.

The house had belonged to their grandfather first, a gentleman naturalist of a kind who did not really exist anymore: the sort who believed that God had written the biological world in a language meant to be read, footnote by footnote, by a single devoted mind. The shelves showed it. Thousands of volumes, leather gone waxy with age, calfskin pale as bone. Elias brushed a spine and pulled his hand back as if from flesh.

He searched until he found the journal that did not belong.

It lay open on the writing desk, where Jonathan had left it. Elias leaned over it, then saw that faint tremor moving under the ink: a cold vibration in the page itself, so low he felt it in his molars.

He hesitated, mouth dry.

The note:

*To Elias,*

*I must attempt description, for to go silent is to lose even the language of warning.*

*The first event was the sound in the well. You remember the well.*

*We covered it in 1973 with two bolted rings of oak, sealed with pitch. You said—no, you insisted—nothing that stank that way and made the soil that sterile could be drawing water fit for anyone to drink. You said, “Jonathan, if you lower a pail down that throat, you’re going to raise it with something’s hand still on the handle.” I laughed at you. I laughed because I believed in geology.*

*I am not laughing, now.*

*Listen: I removed the bolts. I know I swore I’d never do that. I did it anyway. A sound had begun in the well three nights in a row at 4:13 exactly, not before and not after. The first time, I woke thinking a child was down there, humming. The second, I understood there were syllables. The third, I understood the words.*

*They were your name.*

*El-i-as, El-i-as, El-i-as. Patient and almost fond. It was your voice.*

*Forgive me.*

*I had to know how my dead brother could be under the house.*

Elias stopped reading.

He let the words settle. The room had grown too quiet, like air packed in wool. The boards under his boots seemed slightly soft, as if soaked.

Jonathan had always been the younger and always been reckless in the exact way Elias was not. As boys, when their mother was still alive, Elias had kept weathered maps and recorded iron weights, and Jonathan had kept beetles in jars and wanted to dig past the frost line because he was sure the earth was “sleeved in secrets.” Elias had been the one who said no, to everything, reflexively, with the blunt authority of a child who thinks refusal is the same as safety. He had not gone down into the quarry lake. He had not gone out onto the river ice. He had not—until now—unsealed the well.

He would not have answered, either, if the dark itself had whispered his name.

He read on.

*I unbolted the cover by lantern.*

*Immediately: the smell. Not rot. Something prior to rot. You know how meat goes sweet in the summer and you smell its looseness? This was earlier. A smell like a promise of decay. I gagged. I nearly closed it back up. But you kept saying my name. Your voice was wrong in how it bent the vowels, but grief will let you accept wrongness if it offers return.*

*I held the lantern over the opening and leaned in.*

*The light did not go down. It went out.*

*No hiss, no sputter, no fight for oxygen. It was taken. Bitten. As if something with a mouth I could not see had simply eaten light, whole.*

*And then it began to speak.*

*No. “Speak” is what a person does to another person. This was different. This was like being pressed between cold pages and read.*

*It told me where it was from.*

*Brother, it told me about Below.*

Elias stopped again.

Outside the library windows the last of the day had thickened into a bruise-colored dark. The marsh made a long, patient sound like rope sliding over old wood. Somewhere down in the hollow a lone nightbird gave a single, ugly cry and then nothing else, as if scolded.

He traced the next lines with one finger.

*Below is not under us in any sense that pleases the nerves. It is not “subterranean,” though that is how I first tried to frame it. I thought: caverns. I thought: some limestone channel punched through by water. No. Below is adjacent the way fever is adjacent to sleep. You lie down innocent and then wake in a new climate of the skull.*

*It told me this and then it showed me.*

*I must write what I saw. If I do not, the images bruise all over me from inside.*

*The walls there are not stone. They are older than stone, but also less finished. Imagine clay while the hand is still in it, but the hand is not a hand, and the pressure is not crafting, it is wanting. The walls weep a slow, translucent liquid that beads, trembles, and falls upward. The color of that fluid made my stomach quiver. I have to invent a word here. “Ossurine.” Bone-urine. Forgive me.*

*There are structures. They are like towers but also like teeth, and they grow by listening. This was made clear to me. They listen through the well, through all wells, for stories told aboveground. They harden around narrative like a pearl around grit.*

Elias felt, absurdly, a flash of anger. His jaw tightened.

Jonathan loved that sort of baroque mysticism. He always had. As an undergraduate he had driven professors to fury with his insistence that taxonomy was sentimental as much as it was empirical, that classification always betrayed longing. It was beautiful—yes—and it was exhausting. Elias had no patience for crafted dread.

Except that something had warmed the cold hearth. And except that the ink still seemed to hum with a pressure that made his teeth ache.

He swallowed and kept reading.

*There are denizens.*

*Not “creatures.” “Creatures” implies birth in any sense we would bless with that word. These denizens are precipitates. Residues fallen out of a solution too saturated with malice. They drift like mantles through those corridors of unstone, trailing long threads behind them. The threads look frail, soft, silken. They are not.*

*One brushed my wrist (your wrist; I saw it as if I’d raised my own hand) and in that touch I remembered with perfect fidelity a morning that never happened.*

*We were twelve. Mother was alive. She was hanging linens in a sun that smelled like salt, though we never lived by the sea. You were laughing, and you had all your teeth. I watched your laugh fold into itself and unfold, slow as the opening of a flower filmed over hours. I felt what I felt then, love like hunger, and also the certainty of future loss like a nail already in the board.*

Elias stood very still.

He looked down at his own right hand. A faint pale mark crossed the inside of his wrist, an old crescent scar from a dog bite in 1984.

As he watched, the skin around the scar rose in gooseflesh.

That was when he heard it.

“El-i-as,” came a voice from the kitchen doorway, and in that moment he knew two things with such force it nearly buckled him:

One: the voice was his own, made years younger, lifted with that bright derision he hadn’t heard in decades.

Two: his brother was still in this house.

He turned.

“Jonathan,” he said, and the name burst out not like speech but like relief, like an exhale held for too long. He sounded old to himself.

There was no one in the doorway.

The kitchen beyond it lay dark, except for a thin bluish seam of light along the baseboard, like swamp light trapped under the floor.

Now the fear came for him in a bodily way. Ancestral, marrow-deep. Not panic. Panic was loud and wasteful. This was quiet and total, like frost thickening from the edges of a window inward until the last clear oval of view goes blind.

He walked toward the kitchen.

The house made soft small sounds around him, wood settling, pipes cooling, a low steady pulse in the walls like an animal sleeping. The Corcoran house had always been noisy, always murmurous, because houses that stand too long in damp places learn to groan and mutter the way old men do. Tonight it sounded attentive.

The kitchen was colder.

That seam of light along the baseboard was brighter now, almost pearlescent. It leaked from the gap where the rotten plank by the pump sink had always sagged. Elias knelt. His knees flared. He pressed his fingertips against the seam.

Wet. Very faintly warm.

He curled his fingers under the plank and lifted.

The wood came away with a soft, fibrous tear. No nail held it. No resistance at all.

Below, where packed earth should have lain, was an aperture.

Not a hole. Not an absence. Something like a membranous film held in a rough oval by struts of some pale material, flexing faintly as if breathing. The light came through that membrane. Its color hurt. It was not any sane blue, nor green, nor the color of gas flame. It was the color of seeing your own veins lit from within.

From it, very softly, like a child begging through a locked door:

“El-i-as. Help me.”

His throat burned.

“Jonathan,” he whispered. “Tell me where you are.”

“Below,” said Jonathan’s voice, with a kind of patient triumph, as if Elias had finally caught up. “Below. Brother, listen—I have done something singular. I have been allowed in.”

The membrane pulsed.

Elias could smell it now. The not-yet-rot. Ossurine, Jonathan had called it. His stomach clenched and ached.

“You shouldn’t be,” Elias said, and heard the absurdity at once. The old, older-than-childhood need to scold. To assert rules. To insist that reality behaved. He almost laughed. “You shouldn’t be anywhere.”

“I know,” the voice said.

Something moved behind the membrane.

Something large, but not in the way of bodies. A largeness of intention, of reach. Elias had the sudden lunatic impression of a cathedral attempting to press its whole architecture through a keyhole, all its arches bending, all its pillars flexing and wet.

He leaned closer despite himself, squinting against the glare.

And he saw.

He saw his brother’s face.

Not entire. Only parts. An eye, very blue, swimming alone in that veined light, and then a mouth, Jonathan’s mouth with its crooked incisor and the small vertical crease above the upper lip, moving. These pieces drifted in that light like scraps of film in developer tray, sliding past each other, nearly assembling and then passing through.

He gagged, hand to his mouth.

“El-i-as,” said that not-quite mouth. “It’s alone, here. It needs a story. It wants to be known. That’s why it opened the well to me first. I talked to it. I told it about you. I told it why you left. I told it you blamed yourself for the ferry, though you never said so. I told it about the letter you never sent to her. I told it about your hands. Your hands. Brother—”

Elias felt the floor tilt under him.

“You had no right,” he said hoarsely.

The ferry. The letter. The hands. All of it dragged behind those words like nets of knives.

“It doesn’t understand right,” the voice said, faintly amused, and that was Jonathan, unmistakably Jonathan—the cleverness always half a weapon. “It only understands hunger. It is listening to me fade. It can’t keep the shape. It’s trying so hard. Elias. Elias, listen.”

The eye rolled toward him, frantic. The mouth tore out of sight, then slid back, lower. The membrane flexed and quivered. The light brightened until tears sprang down Elias’s face.

“It wants you to come down,” Jonathan whispered. “It wants you to see it. To describe it. To give it edges. It will let me go if you do. It promised.”

Elias said nothing.

Something behind the membrane shivered at that silence, like a dog sensing the leash go slack. The light dimmed a fraction. The pieces of Jonathan steadied, held in the trembling glow.

In that dimness Elias could see something else, farther back.

Depth. A corridor swallowing itself. The suggestion of receding tessellations, each one a little less Euclidean than the last, each one tilting the world sideways in a way that made his stomach revolt.

And movement along those receding walls. Slow, gliding. Mantled shapes, trailing long threads.

One of the threads reached forward, testing the membrane, stroking it in a lover’s way. The membrane swelled under that touch, whiter, thinner.

He remembered Jonathan’s journal, the description of the hook, memory like a nail already in the board. He remembered the invented word, ossurine. He licked his lips, tasted salt and something metallic and bitter.

He saw, with diamond clarity, what Below wanted.

Not just story. Not just edges.

Witness.

And something in him, something quiet and mulish and so old it had no human grammar, said no.

He had failed in other ways. He had failed his mother, and that girl on the ferry in ’82, and himself, over and over, in ways that had left him lean and dry and alone in rented rooms. He had failed Jonathan, too, by leaving him here with this hungry land and its well. Yes. But he would not fail in this particular way.

He would not midwife this thing into the world of names.

He drew in a slow breath. He let it out. He wiped his eyes on the cuff of his coat.

Then, as evenly as he could manage:

“Jonathan,” he said. “Listen to me. You are dead.”

The light flared, furious. The pieces of face spasmed and blurred.

“No,” Jonathan hissed. He sounded like a winter branch dragged across ice. “No, you don’t say it like that, you don’t—”

“You are dead,” Elias repeated. His voice shook now, but he kept going. “You died thirty-one days ago in this house. Whatever speaks with your mouth is not you. I love you. I light a candle for you when I can bear it. But you are not here. And I won’t go down.”

For a heartbeat the kitchen was utterly still.

Then the membrane wailed.

Not with sound. With pressure. With a shove of meaning so huge and raw it felt like a hand pushed into Elias’s chest up to the wrist. His vision went black around the edges. His ears rang. His teeth hummed. He tasted iron. He smelled that premature rot like a tide of soft meat. He felt the first edges of his own memories tug, as if hooked.

He held on.

He thought of stupid things. Petty, human things. The stiff ache in his lower back when he bent. The way coffee left a film on his tongue now. The feel of cheap paperbacks, the invisible grit left on his fingers after a chapter. The way Jonathan used to kick in his sleep and mutter nonsense. The actual sound of his laugh, which had never, not once, said Elias’s name like a prayer.

He held on.

At last, something in the light tore.

The membrane convulsed like skin on boiling milk.

The eye popped like a bubble.

The mouth stretched, split, dissolved in a pale thread that curled and vanished back down, into that impossible depth. The light dimmed to a dull, sick shine. The pressure dropped, all at once, so fast his head swam.

The aperture lay before him. The pale struts that held it twitched, spasmed, then hardened. The membrane dulled. The seam of light shrank to a faint bruise-glow, then to nothing.

Silence.

Not even the house dared creak.

Elias knelt there a long time, hands flat on the cold floor, breath coming in hard, shallow pulls, like a man just out of drowning. The kitchen smelled now of old wood and a faint mineral damp. Ordinary smells. Blessed, stupid, human smells.

His hands would not stop shaking.

At last, moving like an old man, he fitted the plank back over the aperture. It did not quite sit flush anymore. He did not care.

He stood, swayed, and braced himself on the pump sink. His face in the dark window over the sink looked ghastly: sallow, eyes too bright, mouth drawn tight and bloodless. An old animal that had outlived winter out of spite.

Slowly, he went back to the library.

The journal still lay open on the desk. The ink no longer hummed in his teeth. The last lines trailed off mid-sentence where Jonathan had written Brother—

Elias closed the book.

He carried it to the hearth.

The ash there no longer breathed heat. It lay inert and chalky, like the residue of a burned offering.

He did not care.

He set the journal in the cold grate, tore kindling from the woodbox, and lit a match.

For a moment the match flame guttered and trembled and he felt idiot terror, the animal terror of a caveman whose one ember is threatened by rain. Then the kindling caught. Dry pine snapped, flared gold. The paper yellowed, curled, blackened, bloomed into soft, devouring fire. Ink bled and ran and blistered.

As the flames took the first pages, something rose in the chimney with a thin, distant cry, furious and starving and infantile, and then was gone.

Elias watched until each page surrendered and fell inward, until the spine cracked, until the leather split and curled like skin under a sun too close to the world. He watched until the last ember dulled and collapsed into itself—until the story blackened into ash.

Only then did he let himself sit.

He sat on the floor in front of the dead fire, back against the cold stone, hands hanging between his knees. He felt emptied, scooped out, echoing. He knew—deep as bone—that Below had not been ended. You cannot end hunger by refusing to name it. You can only starve it for a while.

He also knew it now knew him. Not his face, maybe. Not his gait. But those stupid, tender sins Jonathan had given it, those soft mortal shames, those small private griefs that make a man a particular man. It had eaten those things, tasted them, learned their weight. Below had pressed itself up against the skin of the world and inhaled him like a scent.

Somewhere beneath his soles, far under frost line and bedrock and whatever lay below bedrock, a cathedral with no god but appetite shifted in its sleep.

Elias lifted his trembling hands and held them up to the weak lamplight.

They were still his.

For now, he thought.

Outside, the marsh wind moved through the reeds in a long low whisper, like pages turning in a book that has no last page. And in that hush, in the pause after the hush, he thought he heard, impossibly far and impossibly near at once, the faintest scrape of hooks along a wall that was not stone, patient as tide, patient as rot, patient as time.
