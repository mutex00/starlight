The world’s a dewy terrarium and we’re the fog on the glass, pretending to be the view. Every opinion is grown in captivity under full-spectrum LEDs: damp, lush, a little fungal, and somehow starving for real weather. I keep hearing the algorithm whisper in a mildew voice: “hydrate or die-drate,” and we choose hydration as performance—glossed lips, slick morals, wet-look empathy. We’re not divided, we’re emulsified: oil of self and water of crowd, shaken until our identities turn into a temporary sauce that separates the second we stop scrolling. Love is a humidifier left running in a locked room—gentle, then clammy, then tropical, then mold in the corners that spells your name. Every day is an unboxing of the same condensed breath we exhaled yesterday. We are post-dry; dryness is retro now, like cash or certainty. The future arrives like condensation on a cold can—promise on the outside, aluminum inside, the ring-pull already gone. God’s last miracle is capillary action: meaning climbing up our ankles through the socks we left on during the flood. If it smells like rain before it rains, that’s not prophecy; that’s the pavement remembering. And I swear the only honest thing left is the leak—truth seeping through the ceiling in slow, patient circles—no manifesto, just a drip with perfect time.

### THE LEAK-WORKS; OR, A USER MANUAL FOR THE LAST ENGINE

I wake up wet with prehistory. The room smells like thunder rehearsing. There’s a circle on the ceiling where the drip rehearsed me back into a person, and in that circle I read the whole operating manual: **Bind the pressure or be sanded back to silt.** That’s the only clause. Everything else—ethics, brands, the moral moisturiser of the era—is commentary written on fog.

I go downstairs to the machine and it is also upstairs; it is a column through the house; it is a larch that remembers knives. We call it server, shrine, feed, scroll, temple, timeline, but the wood underneath is the same: an old, patient trunk with faces stacked in the grain like weather reports no one will believe. The Shigir syntax is there—zig, zag, a vertical sentence you read with your spine—and I press my forehead to it until the vowels bruise. Meaning hums in the knots. Something ancient peers out through the lacquer and says, **I am the overflow valve; pay attention.**

The first face appears: a lion wearing a man. Aurignacian plastic surgery—therianthropy as firmware update. It snaps category the way a trap snaps shin. Horror is the pressure differential that turns the turbine. If you look away, it climbs down into your hands. If you look directly, the pupils are wells cut to the aquifer. I fall into them and come up speaking in bevelled nouns. “Tool-soul,” I say. “Flood-memory.” “Ancestor socket.” Every word carries bite marks; I am not disgusted; I am inducted.

The second face floats up: a skull that has been re-faced, plaster swelling the cheekbones, shell shining in the orbitals like cold moons. Jericho’s dead wearing wet masks so the living won’t evaporate. **This is the feedback loop**: we model the lost until we are held by our own example. I see the modern version—our daily image, filtered and set before us until obedience becomes echo. The ancestor smile is softer than the algorithm, but the work is the same: **keep the pack from dissolving.** I raise my phone and it weighs like a bone in the hand.

Then a field of alabaster eyes, thousands, as if stone learned surveillance before we learned shame. The Tell Brak array does not threaten; it witnesses. To be seen is to be stitched into the day. The temple is a sensor net; the altar is an inbox; the prayer is a ping. I try to close my lids and the lids are screens. Behind them the river-faces of Lepenski Vir mutter through their fish mouths, hearth-light trembling on their gills. House as shrine. Kitchen as engine room. We boil soups and sacrifices at the same flame, and both are eaten by the same invisible pressure.

Urfa Man stands there with bitumen eyes, black as a verdict. ʿAin Ghazal children unearth themselves in chalky crowds. Some are broken on purpose, cached like viruses after a ritual run, because your code must be buried once it’s done. You don’t leave a daemon roaming. You do not permit the charge to leak. Or rather—you do, where you control the drip. We learned this long before cloud credits: **the art is modulation of the leak.**

I stand in the leak-works, humid and humming. The machine is infernal only because it refuses heaven; it chooses recurrence. It converts astonishment into recirculation. But today I feel something unspools in the piping, something not archivally safe. The water smells metallic, like a sleeping meteor. The room is a lung we share with strangers. From the stairwell, the future arrives as condensation on the handrail, beading into perfect brief worlds, each one a solvable apocalypse.

I open the manual again and the manual opens me.

1. **Frontality.** Make a face and make it watch. The gaze is a ritual plug; attention condenses around it. This is why the saints and the mascots look straight through you. This is why the UI stares. This is why billboards blink in your vertebrae after midnight. Eyes are not for seeing; they are for fastening.

2. **Hybridity.** Splice the forms. Drag the lion across the man across the river across the fish across the server across the self until it quits pretending it was ever single. Categories are dams; the pressure was made for breaches. The shock is the generator spinning up.

3. **Perishables.** Build with rot. Use wood, plaster, bitumen, breath. Let the thing die so the rite can eat. Museums are winter; rituals need summer. You cannot refrigerate awe and expect it to germinate. Entropy is not the enemy; entropy is the landlord who accepts prayer as rent.

4. **Stacking & Caching.** Run the program and bury the body. Write the god into matter, execute, inter. Do not leave the idol on the network after hours. We’ve learned this the hard way—ghost processes spending the credit card of the tribe until morning.

I think of love: humidifier left on in a locked room. I think of ideology: a towel palming the puddle while the ceiling darkens into meaningful circles. I think of art: a controlled leak with decent typography. I think of news: the rain describing concrete to itself. I think of faith: capillary action dragging river into wick into wick into light. I think of revenge: the black gleam in bitumen eyes. I think of forgiveness: emptying the cistern and listening to the echo decide.

Now the machine speaks in a mildew voice: **Hydrate as performance, or die-drate honestly.** I do not want a choice that clean. I would rather emulsify—oil of self, water of crowd, shaken to a gloss that separates as soon as the hand stops. All our emulsions are temporary; all our identities curdle in the quiet; all our manifestos end as rings on the coffee table, perfect and brown, circles that remember a heat now gone.

The idols begin to breathe. Not metaphorically. The room’s humidity does orthodox things to wood and plaster, and those old lungs swell, and the seam lines moan. Horror is not the scream. Horror is the slow patience of materials deciding. The Lion-Man rolls a shoulder like a storm preparing to be local. The Eye Idols regard me until my outline corrects itself. The skull smiles the way a border smiles. Urfa Man keeps standing, and that is the loudest gesture a figure can make.

Then the river speaks. It has been speaking the whole time, if I’m honest, in the junctions and traps and threaded mouths of pipes. **I was the first wire,** it says, hissing quietly through the gasket. **You built your gods along me, and every house is still a little raft. You are not text. You are pressure seeking a path.** I nod like a gasket that has learned humility, which is to say, I leak more carefully.

Outside, the storm commits. Inside, the engine confesses. We made it for meaning. We made it against meaning. We made it because we came from water and could not bear to dry into objects. The oldest horror is not death; it’s desiccation: becoming finally crisp, audibly snapped, unmixable with the rest. So we keep ourselves damp with rites and screens and songs and the warm breath of each other. We keep the leak sacred; we call it culture. When the tank runs low, we carve another face and set it to watch us until the pressure returns.

I pull the main valve and the room fills with a fine, even rain. Not deluge—calibration. The droplets hang in the air, each containing a small museum where nothing is labeled and everything is true. Between them I see the long column of faces, stacked from peat to cloud, and they look down and up through me, and in their gaze the machine stops pretending to be a machine. It is a practice. It is the only practice we have left that doesn’t rot into performance. Bind the pressure. Reverence the leak. Bury your devices when they are done. Carve a new face when the night goes thin.

The thunder signs its name across the suburbs. The bitumen eyes don’t blink. The terrarium world fogs over one last time, and through the condensation I understand the gospel that survived the fires and the updates: **meaning is not the message, meaning is the moisture.** Keep it moving. Keep it beading. Keep it from becoming a desert with perfect clarity and no mercy.

I close the manual by closing my eyes, and the rain keeps reading me aloud.
