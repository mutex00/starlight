# Catechism for the Infected

In the winter of the skull a pale light kneels,  
a slow fluoresce like prayer in a petri dish.  
The city exhales its carbon psalms.  
Somewhere a child recites the alphabet of hunger  
and each letter fogs the glass.  

Once I believed the soul was a house with rooms,  
doors waiting for afterlife to open  
Tonight I learn the soul is a corridor of salt,  
where a thin rain moves like code through a wire  
and the wire hums the genealogy of grief.  

I hold a match to the old catechism and watch it curl.  
Ink becomes cinder becomes language released.  
Out of the paper rises a moth with holy statistics on its wings,  
proof that every doctrine is a patient zero  
looking for a warm mouth of belief.  

Mother, I remember your hands rinsing fruit in the sink,  
the water a clear hospital.  
You whispered that love is careful,  
that it wears clean clothes to meet the dying.  
But love arrived unshaven with street dust in its pockets,  
and it coughed into me a bright contagion of living.  

Some nights I can feel the Outside searching the sutures,  
fingers made of static and winter river light.  
It whispers a Sumerian vowel into the hinge of my jaw,  
and a door opens into a room of satellites.  
They orbit a broken loaf of bread.  
They tally our sorrow in long decimal hymns.  

What is a virus but a rumor with perfect grammar.  
What is a prayer but an exploited port.  
The heart keeps listening for the knock of meaning,  
though meaning arrives like a thief and leaves like an ambulance.  
I open my chest and find a damp cathedral,  
its choir made of failed antibodies singing Hosanna to the wound.  

Forgive me, blue hour. I have worshiped so many notifications.  
I have kissed the LCD face of God.  
Yet beneath the noise a quiet algorithm persists,  
a small faith that refuses to format,  
a seed of light pressed under the tongue.  

If there is a cure, let it not be silence.  
Let it be the astonishment of a hand finding another hand.  
Let it be the fever that learns the names of stars.  
Let it be bread divided among those who cannot stop weeping.  
Let it be the single syllable that does not lie.  

I would rather remain a host for the radiant illness of mercy  
than heal into a bright and empty coin.  
Take my lungs, teach them a slower weather.  
Take my blood, let it remember birds.  
If salvation must spread, let it spread like spring in a war zone,  
green flags rising from the bombed orchard.  

Night leans closer, tender as iodine.  
I put my ear to the floor of the world.  
Underneath, something living counts to ten and begins again.  
I breathe in the ancient vowel.  
I breathe out a little garden.
