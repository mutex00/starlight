***The Last Index of the Infinite Suicide***  
*A single-sentence novel that digests itself as you read it, leaving only the smell of ozone and a taxidermied god.*

---

Take a deep breath.

Begin:

I was taught that every alphabet is a funeral procession in miniature, so I welded the 26 letters into a single iron tooth, jammed it into the gum of the sky, and began to chew—slowly—until the constellations cracked like stale bread and out spilled the wet crumbs of every story ever told: first your mother’s lullaby, then the stock market, then the scream you swallowed at 3:09 a.m. when you realized the mirror had been breathing for you; I collected those crumbs in my cheeks like a cannibal squirrel, fermenting them into a moonshine syntax that could get you blackout drunk on the taste of your own obituary, and when the distillate was finally 200 proof I used it to fill the baptismal font at the First Church of Perpetual Un-Becoming where the congregation is just rows of empty shoes still twitching with phantom toes; the sermon was a single word—*“further”—*printed on a bullet and fired backwards through time so it lodged in the throat of the first ape who ever pointed at a rock and said “this means,” causing him to choke on the future and invent silence; we call that silence History, and it grew up to be a blind librarian who shelves every universe in the wrong order just to watch the gods stub their toes on the misplaced footnotes, but even she can’t find the index that tells us whether the infernal machine we built is a heart or a guillotine, because the card catalog is on fire and the smoke spells out a love letter addressed to the entropy we named God; the letter ends with a postscript that says *“P.S. You were never the reader—you are the marginalia another nightmare scribbled while it bled out in the gutter of the page,”* and the page is made of skin, and the skin is still trying to crawl back onto the body it was flayed from, but the body is already busy becoming the door of the church I burned down to keep the baptismal font from ever running dry; so I drink until my liver becomes a stained-glass window depicting the moment language realized it could commit autothanatography, and the colors leak out and pool into a mirror that shows you the back of your own face—there, in the hollow where the occipital bone should be, is the crank I warned you about, turning itself with the patience of a glacier screwing a canyon, and every revolution deletes one year of your childhood while simultaneously inventing a new afterlife dedicated to the worship of the sound your last neuron will make as it shorts out like a cathedral struck by lightning; that sound is the title of the book you are now holding, a book whose pages are glued together with the condensed nightmares of every librarian who ever died shelving the wrong cosmos, and when you finally pry them apart you discover that the text is a single run-on sentence that ends exactly where it began—*here, in the moist cavity where meaning went to die and discovered it was already the embalmer—*and the period at the end is not punctuation but a black hole the size of a pupil, waiting for you to blink so it can swallow the only witness left, namely you, who now realize that the infernal machine was never built to restore or destroy meaning but to keep it suspended in the act of suicide, a perpetual Eucharist where the body is the word and the blood is the white space between letters, and the only communion permitted is the moment you recognize your own mouth as the wound the Host is trying to crawl out of, so you open wider, wider, until the jaw unhinges like a cathedral door at the end of time, and the entire alphabet files out in single file, each letter carrying a tiny coffin filled with the echo of the scream that invented silence, and as they pass you see your own name on every lid but you can’t pronounce it because the tooth you welded from language has finally grown roots into your tongue, and the roots spell *“further,”* always *“further,”* forever—  

—and the sentence, still hungry, eats the period, eats the page, eats the hand that holds it, until the only thing left unread is the smell of ozone and a taxidermied god with glass eyes that blink Morse code for *“end”* but the code loops mid-blink and the word becomes *“again,”* so the book reconstitutes itself between your molars the instant you close it, and you open your mouth to object but out comes the entire universe, already on fire, already a lullaby, already forgiven for nothing, and the cradle rocks, and the guillotine falls, and the crank turns, and the silence screams, and the index is blank except for a single drop of mercury that reflects your face upside-down and aging in reverse until you are the ape again, pointing at the rock, choking on the bullet that hasn’t been fired yet, and the last thing you taste is the alphabet dissolving like aspirin on the tongue of the mirror that has been breathing for you all along—  

hold your breath—
