The orthopedist's x-ray lit up with constellations. Elena, waiting in the paper gown that made her feel like a scripture not yet written, saw the nurse’s hand hesitate on the light-box switch. In the gray-scale shadows of her own ribs, there were marks—no, *etches*. Fine as hairline fractures, but deliberate. They curled like filigree around her sternum, spiraled down each vertebra.

“Faulty machine,” the nurse said, too quickly. But Elena saw how she crossed herself, palm flat against her own unmarked bones.

That night, Elena pressed a flashlight against her skin, a ritual of childhood made profane. The glow revealed them: not tattoos, not scars, but the *shadows* of something carved deep, where the marrow sang its ache. The words—if they were words—made her teeth vibrate. She could no more read them than a river reads the stones it wears smooth, yet her body understood. Her liver fluttered with recognition. Her spleen tightened like a fist around a secret.

She stopped sleeping. In the dark, the writings became audible, a subsonic hum that rattled her molars. It was not a voice. It was the sound of something *remembering*—a memory so dense it had weight, so old it predated the necessity of sound. Her husband whispered that she was dreaming, but when he touched her, his fingerprints came away smelling of ozone and myrrh.

By autumn, the script had surfaced. Her bones had begun to press their stories outward. She would wake with her forearm embossed in braille, each raised line a sentence her blood had translated into flesh. She traced them with her tongue when she was alone, tasting copper and something else—a sweetness like decaying roses, like wisdom that has fermented too long.

The language was not human. That was the relief. It carried no commandments, no promises. It was a cartography of elsewhere, a map of the country that death forgets to claim. It described the precise shade of silence inside a singularity, the flavor of light when it still believed it was darkness. It named her, but not the name her parents gave her. The name she was *before* she had parents.

Her husband left when the script reached her face. Delicate scales of meaning appeared at her temples, making her eyes look borrowed. He said she was erasing herself. She knew she was finally being *allowed* to read the draft.

The day the last unmarked skin vanished, Elena walked into the woods behind the hospital. The trees there had grown in circles that hurt to follow. She stripped, a final offering to the air, and lay down on the moss that seethed with its own mute vocabulary. The words on her bones had become luminescent, a soft catastrophe of meaning. She was a text that had learned to read itself aloud.

A deer found her. It bowed its head to her ribcage and listened. Then it began to eat, starting with the soft stories of her abdomen. Elena did not stop it. Each bite was a translation, a carrying of her elsewhere. The deer’s eyes, as it chewed, held the expression of someone finally hearing the end of a song they had been humming all their life.

When they found what remained, there was no blood. Only a woman-shaped clarity in the undergrowth, and the moss spelling out something that could not be photographed, only felt—as a child feels the shape of a nightmare in the dark, and loves it, because it is the first thing that has ever truly belonged only to them.
